-- be useful for heuristic purposes. However, caveats are needed:
--
-- First, because the VCache writer operates in a background thread,
-- the reference count returned here may be slightly out of date.
--
-- Second, it is possible that VCache will eventually use some other
-- form of garbage collection than reference counting. This function
-- should be considered an unstable element of the API.
--
-- Root PVars start with one root reference.
