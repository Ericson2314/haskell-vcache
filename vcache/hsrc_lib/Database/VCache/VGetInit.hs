-- | For VGet from the database, we start with just a pointer and a
-- size. To process the VGet data, we also need to read addresses
-- from a dedicated region. This is encoded from the end, as follows:
--
--     (normal data) addressN offset offset offset offset ... bytes
--
-- Here 'bytes' is basically a varNat encoded backwards for the
-- number of bytes (not counting 'bytes') back to the start of the
-- first address. This address is then encoded as a varNat, and any
-- offset is encoded as a varInt with the idea of reducing overhead
-- for encoding addresses near to each other in memory.
--
-- Addresses are encoded such that the first address to parse is last
-- in the sequence (thereby avoiding a list reverse operation).
--
-- To read addresses, we simply read the number of bytes from the end,
-- step back that far, then read the initial address and offsets until
-- we get back to the end. This must be performed before we apply the
-- normal read operation for the VGet state. It must be applied exactly
-- once for a given input.
