-- VCache uses LMDB with the MDB_NOLOCK option, mostly because I don't
-- want to deal with the whole issue of OS bound threads or a limit on
-- number of concurrent readers. Without locks, we essentially have one
-- valid snapshot. The writer can begin dismantling earlier snapshots
-- as needed to allocate pages.
--
-- RWLock essentially enforces this sort of frame-buffer concurrency.

--
-- NOTE: Each of these 'frames' actually contains readers of two
-- transactions. Alignment between LMDB transactions and VCache
-- RWLock isn't exact.
--
-- Each write lock will rotate reader frames just once:
--
--     (f1,f2) â†’ (f0,f1) returning f2
--
-- Writer is working on LMDB frame N.
--
-- f0 will have readers for frame N-1 and (after commit) for N.
-- f1 will have readers for frame N-2 and some for N-1.
-- f2 will have readers for frame N-3 and some for N-2.
--
-- LMDB guarantees that the data pages for frames N-1 and N-2 are
-- intact. However, frame N-3 will be dismantled while building
-- frame N. Thus, we must wait for f2 readers to finish before we
-- begin the writer N transaction.
--
-- If we assume short-running readers and long-running writers, it
-- is rare that the writer ever needs to wait on readers. Readers
-- never need to wait on the writer. This assumption is achieved by
-- batching writes  in VCache.
