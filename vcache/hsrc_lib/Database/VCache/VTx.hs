-- | Durability for a VTx transaction is optional: it requires an

-- are batched, a durable transaction may share its wait with many
-- other transactions that occur at more or less the same time.
--
-- Developers should mark a transaction durable only if necessary
-- based on domain layer policies. E.g. for a shopping service,
-- normal updates and views of the virtual shopping cart might not
-- be durable while committing to a purchase is durable.
