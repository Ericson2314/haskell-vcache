-- | When we're just about done with VPut, we really have one more
-- task to perform: to output the address list for any contained
-- PVars and VRefs. These addresses are simply concatenated onto the
-- normal byte output, with a final size value (not including itself)
-- to indicate how far to jump back.
--
-- Actually, we output the first address followed by relative offsets
-- for every following address. This behavior allows us to reduce the
-- serialization costs when addresses are near each other in memory.
--
-- The address list is output in the reverse order of serialization.
-- (This simplifies reading in the same order as serialization without
-- a list reversal operation.)
--
-- It's important that we finalize exactly once for every serialization,
-- and that this be applied before any hash functions.

-- putChildren receives a stack (last in first out), so we'll just
-- write them in order. Our first address is written as a natural
-- number, then each following address is written as a difference.
